Hey guys, it looks like it worked. Almost everyone is convinced we are just testing simulated reality. However, there are still a few individuals who could cause us problems. I’ve already sent a request to the Monitoring Department and asked them to keep an eye on them. They’ll inform me of every step they take.

Frank, take care of the hiring of the next group as soon as possible.
