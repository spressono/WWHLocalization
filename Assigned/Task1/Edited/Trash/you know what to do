Hi Frank,

I just seen the reports. We almost completely destroyed their society. Some of the employees have started to notice that something is wrong, so it would be best to hire new ones and repeat the experiment. And, of course, we need to convince everyone its just a simulation. Marcus wants us to continue the experiment at all costs. Hopefully it wont be as destructive as the first attempt, you know what to do.

After reading this, it would be best to delete this email. Just to be sure.
