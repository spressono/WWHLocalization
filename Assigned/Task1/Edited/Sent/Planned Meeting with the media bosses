Hi all,

So far, our plan is working perfectly. My assistant has already received the next instructions so don’t make any plans for Saturday evening; I need you all available. She organized a meeting with all the “Big fish” that could jeopardize this whole operation. We have to keep the media silent at all costs, start thinking about the appropriate number of coins we should pay them off with.
