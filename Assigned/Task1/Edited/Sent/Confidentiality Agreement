Hello Greta.

Please send me the up-to-date NDA. I have an appointment in a few days with a TV director along with two radio directors. I want to check it out before any of our meetings take place. I hope we hired the best lawyer we could, can you tell him to contact me? I need to speak with him directly, especially to solve these finance issues.

Thanks, Frank
