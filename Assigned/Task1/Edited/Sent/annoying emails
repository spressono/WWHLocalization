Hi Greta,

Please contact the IT Department and have them set up my SPAM filter. I don’t need to have emails I don’t need to respond to, or ones that are not marked “important,” in my inbox, I want them to go into my spam folder.

I’m annoyed by a million messages from colleagues who constantly write insignificant things. They send it to the group email, and I just waste my time reading something that I don’t need to be reading.

Thanks, Frank
