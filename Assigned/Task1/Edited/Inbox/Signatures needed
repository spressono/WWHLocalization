Hi all,

We’ve stated on all our social media networks that we are looking for people to test our application. I’ll let you all know about any further details that arise.

I propose that we wait for a few days and select only the best candidates. It’s a grand experiment so we need to be sure that this only gets into the hands of the right people. The official project document is ready, I only need your signatures so I will be bringing it in after lunch.
