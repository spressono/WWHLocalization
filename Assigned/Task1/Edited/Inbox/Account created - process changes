Account created - process changes

A new employee account has been created!

Attention:
Due to numerous reports of unauthorized use and access of company systems, we've decided to make the rules for new employees more restrictive. Per a new company policy, access to the systems won't be granted for new employees until their account is activated by their manager.

The activation process is simple, you must run the "manage_user" tool that is located on your system. You can also find a manual that includes the proper syntax for use with the manage_user. Lastly, you can access your local system through the "NETWORK" tab.

If you encounter any problems or suspect any unauthorized use of company systems, please, contact the Security Department. Any problems will be addressed in the order they are received. Also, please note that all inactive accounts will be deleted after some time.
