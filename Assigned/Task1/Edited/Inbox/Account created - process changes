Account created - process changes
FROM:	SYSTEM MESSAGE

DATE:	NOW

New employee account has been created !

Attention!
Due to several repeated cases of abuse of the rights in the company system, we decided to make the rules for newcomers more restrictive. According to the new company process, access to the system won't be granted to newcomers as long as their accounts won't be activated.

To account activation as a manager, run the manage_user tool. You'll find the tool and also a manual on how to use it on your computer through the NETWORK menu.

In case of any problems or suspicion, please, contact the Security department to resolve this issue. Unactivated accounts will be after the waiting time has elapsed deleted.
