Hello Frank.

All right, everything is equipped, the technicians have set it up. As you wished, all collective team emails which you'll receive, but:

- in which you won't be marked as the who should answer, or
- they won't be marked as "important"

will be automatically sent directly to your SPAM folder.

Colleagues are informed about it. So if they don't tag you in the email, they won't expect your response.
