Hello Frank,

The technicians set up your spam folder, as you requested. You will receive all team emails apart from the following:

- Emails that do not request a response from you
- Emails that are not marked as “important”

Emails that are caught by the filter will be sent directly to your SPAM folder.

Our colleagues have been informed of the change. So, if they don’t request a response in their email, they will not expect one.

Greta
