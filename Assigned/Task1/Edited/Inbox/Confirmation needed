Confirmation needed
FROM:	GRETA SMITH
TO:	FRANK POULSEN
DATE:	NOW

Hi Frank,

I saw that a new employee account was created. Therefore I need you to confirm the assignment to project for him.
Confirm the project in my shared documents on my computer because, in recent days, we have had the HR system often down. In that cases, I used to look into my local documents for confirmations finding.

By the way, don't forget that you also still have a debt of 4.82 quantcoins. It's marked with the red warning color in the report, and they might notice it in the finance department. I don't want to have some problems, so please give quantcoins back to me. I'm waiting for them too long.

P.S.: Without paying your debt, I won't cooperate on this confirmation and neither other requirements from your team!

Call me or at least cover the debt and confirm the assignment.
