Confirmation needed
FROM:	GRETA SMITH

DATE:	TODAY

Hi Frank,

I see that a new employee account was created. So, I need you to confirm what project they’re under.

Recently, since the HR system has been down, I’ve been confirming what projects employees are under by using the documents in my shared documents folder. It’s nice to have a local copy so I can just open the folder and confirm them myself.

Oh, by the way, don’t forget you still owe me 4.82 quantcoins. Its showing up red in the finance report and it’s only a matter of time before the Finance Department notices. I don’t want anymore problems. So please, pay me my quantcoins. I’ve been waiting too long.

P.S.: If you don’t pay your debt, I won’t confirm this new account or help with any other requirements of your team!

Call me or at least cover the debt to confirm your new employees project.
