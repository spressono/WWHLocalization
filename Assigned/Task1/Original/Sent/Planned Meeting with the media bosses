Hi all,

So far, the plan works perfectly. The assistant has already received the next instructions. Don't make any own plans on Saturday evening, you have to be available. She organized a meeting with all the "big fish" that could jeopardize us. We must keep the media silent at all costs. Think about what is the appropriate amount of coins that should be enough for them.
