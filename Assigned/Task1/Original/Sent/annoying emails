Hi Greta,

Please, contact the technical support department and arrange for me that all collective team emails (which I'll receive but in which I'm not required to answer or which they won't be marked as "important") will be automatically sent directly to my SPAM folder.

I'm annoyed by a million messages from colleagues who often write about insignificant things. They post it into collective team email conversations, and then I just waste time reading something I don't really need.

Thanks, Frank
