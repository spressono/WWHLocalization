Hello Greta.

Please, send me the Confidentiality Agreement. I have an appointment in a few days with the TV director and the two radio directors, so I want to check it out before the meeting takes place. I hope the lawyer has made his the best. Call him to contact me. I need to deal with him, especially to solve finances.

Thanks, Frank
