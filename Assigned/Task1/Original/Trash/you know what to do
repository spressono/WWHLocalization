Hi Frank,

I saw the reports. We have almost completely destroyed their society. Some employees are already starting to notice something is wrong here, so we need to hire new ones to repeat the experiment on the next copy. And, of course, we need to convince everyone that this is just a simulation. Anyway, Marcus wants to continue the experiment at all costs. Hopefully, it won't be so destructive as the first attempt. You know what to do.

After reading, you'd better delete this email, just for sure.
