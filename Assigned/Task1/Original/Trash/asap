Hi guys, it looks like it works. Almost everyone is convinced that they are testing simulated reality, but there are still a few individuals who could cause us problems. I have already sent a request to the Monitoring department and ask them to monitor them. They will inform me about each step.

Frank, take care about hiring the next ones as soon as possible.
