Available exploits:

@exploit coin_notify_port: Exploit coin wallet to notify you about every received transaction. Exploit uses watchlog service port.
@exploit prot_guess: Exploit uses tracecheck security hole to guess password of prot tool. Exploit will return 10 variants of possible password from which one is correct.
@exploit last_connections: Exploit uses firewall bug to retrieve network log of target node without gaining access to it. Requires basic version of firewall.
@exploit firewall: Exploit tries to create custom packets and send to opened ports to find a configuration that won't trigger the firewall rule on the selected port. Afterwards, an exploit on the cracked port can be used. More ports are opened, faster exploit works.
@exploit read_wallet: Using securecon bug related to coins, allow to read current coin wallet status.
@exploit webserver_cmd: Uses webserver to gain command line access to node exploiting unsecured api connection between webserver and tracer service.
@exploit dump_rights: Tries to access node rights configuration and read them using max prot2 service.
@exploit chat_remote: Send a fake message using chat and securecon bug from the owner of targeted node
@exploit db_inject: Inject DB command using web service, executing it on target node database.
@exploit dos_db: Make DoS attack on DB service killing DB after enough concurrent DoS attacks (DDoS needed to kill service).
@exploit drop_firewall: Exploit uses misconfiguration in firewall on prot service dropping down firewall.
@exploit miner_reset: Exploit miner service resetting target node.
@exploit prot_break: Exploit connect protection (prot1) using miner while tracer is running. Exploits require both tracer and miner run on target node.

Use in two steps.
1. First type "miner" when password is requested after connection.
2. Acquired code from memory and past it to this exploit as parameter with port of tracer.
@exploit miner_ip: Exploit changes miner IP address to which coins are sent. Exploit uses standard connect port.
@exploit dump_ram: Dumps ram of currently accessed machine
@exploit slowdown: Start sending huge amount of packets on more complex prot3/prot4 service which significantly slow down target system.
@exploit dos_jail: Exploit drops jail service by generating attack traffic on target node which node cannot handle.
@exploit ftp_get: Reads and download content of any file to /home/downloads using FTP service bug when running with port_logger
@exploit ddos_honeypot: Creates DDoS on honeypot service using botnet network, disabling honeypot and enabling direct access to system.
@exploit dos_firewall: Make DoS attack on firewall or firewall2 version using bad configuration of protreset services enabling DoS attack and restarting firewall.
@exploit ftp_root: Exploit FTP service of the current node on OS version Razor v4 login in as a standard user and get root rights afterwards.
@exploit disable_notify: Send huge amount of notifications on target system disabling notifications and at the same time listening to ones targeted for this IP
@exploit chat_spoof: Send chat message as another user by exploiting his node chat service
@exploit read_logs: Try to read system /logs/ due to OS error on systems with OS Rapid+ v3.1 or older.
@exploit session_steal: Steal connection session created between server with running webserver and client who use browser. After execution, browser will use new session until run browser clear
@exploit reset_firewall: Exploit uses latest OS versions bug to force firewall (not firewall2) to reset, gaining time for other attacks while it starts again
@exploit ddos_miner: Creates DDoS on any miner service using botnet network, significantly slowing down target system due to conreset service behavior for each bot node used.
